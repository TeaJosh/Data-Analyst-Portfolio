## Projects

#### Car Sales Analysis

For this project, I analyzed car sales data to uncover trends in customer preferences, pricing dynamics, and sales patterns. The analysis examined 23,906 transactions across 7 regions to identify key factors influencing car pricing and sales, understand customer demographics and purchasing behavior, analyze temporal trends, and evaluate dealer performance. I performed statistical testing including correlation analysis, chi-square tests, and t-tests to validate findings and provide actionable business recommendations.

The skills showcased in this project are data importing and cleaning, feature engineering, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, data aggregation and grouping, time series analysis, customer segmentation, data visualization, and business reporting.
